# Student Database
this is an one way that a schooling institution could store, add, remove and generally manage the information on their students.  

‚ö†Ô∏è I have used the external libraries colorama, matplotlib, mysql


üìù Note: I made two different versions
1. Done entirely in python, using python data structures to store and filter all the information
2. Done in python with a connection to a private SQL server and stored all the information in tables and using SQL queries to filter the information. (Because it was done with a connection to a private server it will not work accordingly if ran anywhere else)
